<ul><li id="yPCHVKsJf" class="document-bullet"><p>Dear Mom,</p>
</li>
<li id="NjcG9GoK-" class="document-bullet"><p>Mya told me that I need to share my feelings about Thyroid Cancer with you. I guess you had asked her how I was doing with it all, which you certainly deserve to know. Below is my attempt at explaining.</p>
</li>
<li id="DClIBhArJ" class="document-bullet"><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
</li>
<li id="6YE3vQNgs" class="document-bullet"><p>The truth is I haven't felt like I need to organize my emotions on it until now. I have considered the cancer something out of my control since the diagnosis and (perhaps <a href="https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/stoicism-is-not-enough">lazily</a>) have followed the doctors orders blindly, keeping a &quot;stoic&quot; mindset along the way. </p>
</li>
<li id="dk5KI-yoV" class="document-bullet"><p>I think I have cried twice. I know I did this past December. Learning that the cancer was not only still there, but that it had spread to my lymph nodes was harder than the initial diagnosis. It really hurt me. I let myself feel sorry for myself for a bit, which I needed, but in the end what good does feeling sorry do? </p>
</li>
<li id="MlUrpVyMY" class="document-bullet"><p>Life is a bit of a roll of the dice and I have consistently won. Being born to you and Dad was a win of a lifetime itself. There is approximately a <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/thyro.html">1.2% chance in contracting Thyroid Cancer</a>, though that probability is certainly much lower for someone my age. It was just a bad roll in a bigger game and I&#39;m still doing quite alright! Heck even being born in the U.S. is just a 4.25% chance.</p>
</li>
<li id="Je94Qi2tp" class="document-bullet"><p>Luck aside, I have taken a rather apathetic approach. It&#39;s how I default to confronting things that might hurt me - emotional or otherwise. In reality, I can take steps to help my battle. I can eat healthily (which I do, thanks so much in part to you), get adequate sleep, workout, and finally make informed decisions about my cancer care. </p>
</li>
<li id="_osrnS_Kj" class="document-bullet"><p>I haven&#39;t done the best at the last one, partly because I have you in my corner. I can rely on you to do the research and make the phone calls. Taking time out of my schedule forces me to face the fact that I have cancer, which means that I have to confront my emotions. You deserve having me engaged and opinionated in my care and after experiencing the screw-up at SLU, I realize that I have to be diligent. From here on out, my health takes number one priority.   </p>
</li>
<li id="-RIQsUrTg" class="document-bullet"><p>Throughout it all, having you, Dad, Mya and the Grandparents cheering me on has given me great strength. This will be just one obstacle in my great adventure of life! </p>
</li>
<li id="v0W9rccJp" class="document-bullet"><p>I Love You,</p>
