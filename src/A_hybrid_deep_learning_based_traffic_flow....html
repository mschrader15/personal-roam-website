</li>
<li><p><em>A hybrid deep learning based traffic flow prediction method and its understanding</em> is the most cited article in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0968090X">Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</a>. I figured that I should start at the top for my 2021 experiment of summarizing a few papers a week.</p>
</li>
<li><h3 id="so-lets-get-into-it">So let&#39;s get into it:</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Why do I think this paper is so well cited? There are a couple key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p> The keywords: traffic flow prediction, neural networks, deep neural networks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The emphasis on visualization!</p>
</li>
<li><p>This paper is well written.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><h3 id="the-neural-networks--traffic-prediction">The neural networks &amp; traffic prediction</h3>
</li>
<li><p>The paper highlights two goals, one being to making accurate predictions of traffic flow based on the current state. The other stated goal is to present and understand the neural network&#39;s prediction mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Predicting traffic flow (typically # of vehicles and/or traffic speed) has been attempted throughout traffic engineering history but with the development and interest in machine learning, it has seen a resurgence, albeit with new technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>This paper uses a <span class="rm-highlight">deep learning model</span>, which was fairly novel at the point that this article was published. The authors cite traffic flow&#39;s non-linearities, as well as the spatio-temporal data structure as the reason for selecting a &quot;deep&quot; model<ul>
<li>&quot;Plain neural networks suffer from their shallow-ness in the traffic space, where the input data is deep&quot;</li>
<li>Traffic flow is similar to video and audio in that is has characteristics in both the space and time domains.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The authors propose a deep learning model that employees two different neural networks:<ul>
<li>A deep convolutional neural network is used for the spatial features of the network and recurrent neural networks were used for the temporal data</li>
<li>Speed data was used to train an &quot;attention model&quot; to deal with the level of importance of recent traffic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3 id="how-did-it-all-work">How did it all work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The network:<ul>

<li>It is a corridor of Interstate 405, considering only the Northbound direction<ul>
<li>33 detectors, data from PeMS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The real-world traffic data (speed and traffic counts) is aggregated into 5 minute intervals and made available to the neural networks is as follows:<ul>
<li>Say it is 6:30PM, then we want to predict! 6:35, 6:45, ..., till 7:15pm .</li>
<li>To predict these 45 minutes of traffic, the model looks back<ul>
<li>105 minutes in the current day,</li>
<li>30 minutes before and after 6:30PM on the previous day</li>
<li>30 minutes before and after 6:30PM t-1 week</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3 id="the-results">The results:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="rm-highlight">The results weren&#39;t clearly communicated</span>, but it was clear by the results section that accuracy of the neural network prediction was not main goal of the paper - and I think that is okay. As we will see in the section below, the goal was visualization and clear communication and it </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><h3 id="the-visualization">The visualization!</h3>
</li>
<li><p>The authors put emphasis on the visualization techniques used in this paper, because as they state:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In the transportation field, data-driven methods especially the neural network approach have long been criticized for its explain-ability. Neural network has long been regarded as a “black box” because it is difficult to understand due to the large number of neurons, complicated structures, and non-linear function (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0090">Karlaftis and Vlahogianni, 2011</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0120">Lippi et al., 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18302651?via%3Dihub#b0320">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).&quot;</li>
